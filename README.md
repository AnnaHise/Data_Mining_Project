# Data Mining Project

Full EDA (exploratory data analysis) and five distinct classification models that determined whether an indicidual made over $50K annually

## Task 1: Libraries and Importing the Dataset
* Identifies the different libraries used to perfrom analysis of the dataset and a brief description of what they will be used for

## Task 2: High Level Exploration
* High level interpretation of the dataset
  * using commands such as .info(), .describe(), .head(), and checking for null values

## Task 3: Target Variable Exploration
* Column by column analysis (excluding target variable)
  * Data types/values, counts, descriptive summaries, graphs, etc...

## Task 4: Target Variable Exploration
* Brief analysis of the target variable 


## Task 5: Target Exploration by Predictors
* Split into two different sections: Target Exploration by Numeric Predictors and Target Exploration by Categorical Predictors
  * using boxplots, countplots, crosstab, etc...

## Task 6: Data Encoding
* Using pd.get_dummies to encode the dataframe

## Task 7: Model Building & Evaluation
* Decision Tree, SVM, MLP, KNN, and Majoirty Classifier models using train/test split
* Evaluation of models, comparison to baseline model and final recommendation
